Welcome to LibraryFind!
-----------------------

LibraryFind is designed to be an easy-to-use, fast, easy-to-set up, and 
easy-to-maintain system for integrating access to diverse library resources.  
Our goal is to make any information resource just two clicks away - one click 
to find, one click to get.  

To install and run LibraryFind, you will need to be familiar with running
Ruby on Rails applications, setting up MySQL databases, and installing some
additional software libraries.  If you don't already have this experience,
any system administrator near you should be able to get up and running with
LibraryFind in under an hour.  See GETTING STARTED below for details.

LibraryFind is software developed by the Oregon State University Libraries, 
funded in part by a grant from the State Library.


GETTING STARTED
---------------

You will need to be comfortable running Ruby on Rails applications in particular,
and with system administration in general, to install, configure, and successfully
run LibraryFind.  The entire system (search backend, harvester, indexing, 
database, and web front-end) can be run on any Unix-like system, and the web 
front-end can be run on Windows machines which connect to a remote system over
the web using WSDL.

To get going, read INSTALL.txt for details, and visit http://libraryfind.org/
to find links to email lists, online documentation, and other resources.
